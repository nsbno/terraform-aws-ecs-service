= ECS Service Module
:toc:
:!toc-title:
:!toc-placement:

A simplification to get ECS Services up and running, without having to think about the details.

toc::[]

== About

This module helps you get up and running with an ECS Service.
It sets up your service, and links it with VPCs, load balancers, monitoring, and more.

You can focus on your application, and the module takes care of getting it running ðŸŽ‰

== Examples

The link:examples/[examples folder] is the home of example usages of this module.
These are the examples you can find there.

link:examples/simple/[Simple]::
The minimum usage of this module.

link:examples/on-prem/[On Prem]::
Run your service directly in an on-prem datacenter using ECS Anywhere.

link:examples/autoscaling/[Autoscaling]::
A simple service using autoscaling to handle increased load.

link:examples/autoscaling-with-custom-metrics/[Autoscaling with custom metrics]::
A service using autoscaling to handle increased load based on custom metrics.

== Arguments

These are the arguments that can not be expressed by the terraform module

=== `application_container` and `sidecar_containers`

These arguments are where you specify everything ECS needs to know about your container and how to run it.

Both use the same format, but `application_container` will automatically be set as an essential container, while `sidecar_container` will not be set as essential.


|===
|Name |Description |Required |Default

|`name`
|The name of the container, must be unique.
|yes
|n/a

|`image`
|The image (and tag) of the container to run
|yes
|n/a

|`command`
|A command to run on the container
|no
|null

|`essential`
|If the container is essential for the service
|no
|`true` if `application_container`, `false` otherwise

|`environment`
|A map of environment variables
|no
|Empty map

|`secrets`
|A map of secrets
|no
|Empty map

|`port`
|A port to expose from the container.
|depends (required for `application_container`)
|null

|`protocol`
|The application layer protocol for the exposed port.
|depends (required for `application_container`)
|null

|`health_check`
|Container health checks. Not to be confused with LB health checks.
|no
|null

|`cpu`
|The number of CPU units reserved for this container.
|no
|null

|`memory_hard_limit`
|The max amount of memory that the specific container can consume.
|no
|null

|`memory_soft_limit`
|A soft memory limit, that ECS will do best effort to follow when memory is lacking for the service.
|no
|null

|`extra_options`
|Configure any other options for container definitions
|no
|None (Though log_configuration is automatically configured for CloudWatch)
|===



=== `lb_health_check`

These are health checks that will be executed by the loadbalancer.

See link:https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/lb_target_group#health_check[the `health_check` documentation for `aws_lb_target_group`].


== Considerations

=== Platform differences

The different platforms are quite similar, but some considerations have to be taken.

==== Fargate

You must make sure that the following arguments are present:

* `lb_listeners`
* `private_subnet_ids`
* `vpc_id`

==== ECS Anywhere

Please keep the considerations from AWS in mind.
Only use ECS Anywhere if it is really neccessary.
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-anywhere.html#ecs-anywhere-considerations

Main things to note:

* There is no VPC networking
* No loadbalancers

=== Migrating from `terraform-aws-ecs-fargate` and `terraform-aws-ecs-anywhere`

A guide is available if you were previously using `terraform-aws-ecs-fargate` or `terraform-aws-ecs-anywhere`.

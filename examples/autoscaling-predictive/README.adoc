= Predictive Autoscaling

This example shows a simple service with predictgive autoscaling.

When using predictive autoscaling, AWS will analyze historical data to predict future traffic patterns and adjust the number of running tasks accordingly.

Using `predictive_scaling_mode = "ForecastOnly"` will allow AWS to make scaling recommendations based on historical data without actually changing the number of running tasks.

Afterwards, you can change the mode to `"ForecastAndScale"` to enable automatic scaling based on the predictions.

Using `predefined_metric_pair_type = "ALBRequestCount"`
requires `resource_label` in the format:
`app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>/targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id>`.

This can be found by using the last part of the load balancer and target group ARNs.
